# The PROM

> After entering the door, you navigate through the building, evading guards, and quickly locate the server room in the basement. Despite easy bypassing of security measures and cameras, laser motion sensors pose a challenge. They're controlled by a small 8-bit computer equipped with AT28C16 a well-known EEPROM as its control unit. Can you uncover the EEPROM's secrets?

So we're presented with an interface for controlling an `AT28C16` EEPROM.

The interface seems simple enough, we just need make sure to set the correct voltage levels for the chips pins. I've worked with EEPROMs before so it's familiar.

Let's try to dump the entire EEPROM and look at the data.


## Dumping The EEPROM

I wrote a script and made sure to set all the right voltage levels on the pins. A loop read through all `2048` memory locations; `0x000` to `0x7FF`.

```bash
set_address_pins([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
b'> Read 0x0 at address 0x0\n'
set_address_pins([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5])
b'> Read 0x0 at address 0x1\n'
set_address_pins([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0])
b'> Read 0x0 at address 0x2\n'
set_address_pins([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5])
b'> Read 0x0 at address 0x3\n'
set_address_pins([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0])
b'> Read 0x0 at address 0x4\n'
# ...abbreviated
set_address_pins([5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,5])
b'> Read 0x0 at address 0x7fd\n'
set_address_pins([5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0])
b'> Read 0x0 at address 0x7fe\n'
set_address_pins([5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5])
b'> Read 0x0 at address 0x7ff\n'
[*] Closed connection to 83.136.252.32 port 54301
```

That was not expected, seems like the EEPROM is empty!


## A Deeper Look Into The Datasheet

The `AT28C16` has an extra 32 bytes of memory which is only available under a specific situation. The pin `A9` must be set to 12 volts!

![Alt text](images/00.png)

This basically overlays the memory range `0x7e0` to `0x7ff` with a special `DEVICE IDENTIFICATION` memory area. This area is also writeable. Can the flag hide inside this area?!


## Dumping The `DEVICE IDENTIFICATION` Memory

### Solve Script

Full script: [`solver.py`](solver.py)

```python
from pwn import *

def set_address(address):
    # Convert to binary string, remove '0b', and pad with zeros
    binary_string = bin(address)[2:].zfill(11)

    # Replace every high bit with a 5 for 5 volts
    binary_string = binary_string.replace('1', '5')

    # Make comma separated list
    binary_string = ','.join(binary_string)

    # Split the list so we can manipulate it
    binary_list = binary_string.split(',')

    # Make sure A9 is always 12 volts
    binary_list[-10] = '12'

    # Rejoin the list
    binary_string = ','.join(binary_list)

    # Create final command
    binary_string = 'set_address_pins([' + binary_string + '])'
    #print(binary_string)
    conn.sendline(binary_string.encode())


remote_ip = '83.136.254.199'
remote_port = 46073

conn = remote(remote_ip, remote_port)

print(conn.recvuntil(b'> ').decode())
print(conn.recvuntil(b'> ').decode())

conn.sendline(b'set_ce_pin(0)') # active low

address = 0x7e0

flag = ''

while (address < 0x800):
    conn.sendline(b'set_oe_pin(5)') # active low
    conn.recvuntil(b'> ')
    conn.sendline(b'set_we_pin(5)') # active low
    conn.recvuntil(b'> ')
    set_address(address)
    conn.recvuntil(b'> ')
    conn.sendline(b'set_oe_pin(0)') # active low
    conn.recvuntil(b'> ')
    conn.sendline(b'read_byte()')
    read_byte_line = conn.recvline()
    print(read_byte_line)

    pattern = r'0x[0-9A-Fa-f]+'
    matches = re.findall(pattern, read_byte_line.decode())
    char = chr(int(matches[0], 16))
    flag += char

    address += 1

print(flag)

# Close the connection
conn.close()

```
