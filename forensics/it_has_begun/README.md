## Recon

Looking at the attached file `script.sh` I found a few clues quickly, namely the `{BTH` and `NG5kX3kwdVJfR3IwdU5kISF9` cought my attention. The first string seemed to be a reversed part of the flag, and the second string seemed to be a base64 encoded string. I combined these two and for some reason thought I was missing a middle part which led me down a small rabbit hole.

I used CyberChef for the decoding and reversing.

### Part of RSA key
```
tS_u0y_ll1w{BTH

Reversed -> 

HTB{w1ll_y0u_St
```

### Random hash
```
NG5kX3kwdVJfR3IwdU5kISF9

From Base64 ->

4nd_y0uR_Gr0uNd!!}
```
https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false)&input=Tkc1a1gza3dkVkpmUjNJd2RVNWtJU0Y5

```
Combined:

HTB{w1ll_y0u_St4nd_y0uR_Gr0uNd!!}
```

### Punycode?

For some reason I got an error using the flag (copy-paste error or something), which led me down a small rabbit hole. Looking at the part of the URLs `0xda4` (decimal 3492) led me to believe I had to use punycode (RFC 3492) to get the flag. This was not the case, but it was a fun detour.

```
Punycode: A Bootstring encoding of Unicode for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
RFC 3492
```

## Flag
The flag was simply:

`HTB{w1ll_y0u_St4nd_y0uR_Gr0uNd!!}`
